'''

Write a script that takes in a list of numbers and:
    - sorts the numbers
    - stores the numbers in tuples of two in a list
    - prints each tuple

If the user enters an odd numbered list, add the last item
to a tuple with the number 0.

Note: This lab might be challenging! Make sure to discuss it with your mentor
or chat about it on our forum.

for item in my_list:
    print(f"Item in list: {item}")


my_word_one = "Hello"
my_word_two = "World"

my_word_two_spaced = f'{my_word_two:>50}'
print(my_word_one + my_word_two_spaced)


# greeting = "hello"
#
# spaced_greeting = f"{greeting:>20}"
# print(spaced_greeting)
