Stack Solution (extra space)
1. initiate a stack
2. iteriate over entire string
3. append each character to the stack
4. create a pointer
5. while loop to iterate over stack while characters are in the string pop the top of the stack & set it to the beginning of the strings index
6. increment the pointer

def reverseVowels(self, s):
        stack = []
        for v in s:
            stack.append(v)
        
        i = 0
        while stack:
            s[i] = stack.pop()
            i += 1



Recursive Solution 
def revers(l, r):
  if l < r:
      s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
      reverse(l + 1, r - 1)
reverse(0, len(s) - 1)
